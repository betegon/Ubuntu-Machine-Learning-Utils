# UBUNTU MACHINE LEARNING UTILS

This repository contains a set of utils that are useful when you are about to set a machine for machine learning projects.

## Anaconda-Navigator Desktop entry
As Ubuntu does not have a desktop entry for Anaconda-Navigator, it is a good idea to create one. Anaconda is a tool you will want to use daily in your ML projects. 

I personally prefer using a terminal for managing Anaconda but the navigator lets you dive into your Anaconda first steps.

### Steps
1.  Modify *betegon* with your Ubuntu username.
2.  Be sure you have python 3.7 installed in Anaconda, if other version, change it in the file.
3.  Move `Anaconda.desktop` to `/usr/share/applications` with root permissions.
	* `mv Anaconda.desktop /usr/share/applications`
